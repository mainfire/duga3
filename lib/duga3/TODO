needs an example of how to upload a new torrent to the database, specifically one that can be handled with the current layout of the crawler (ie, not breaking it, etc).

needs a better way to catch the "inner exceptions" within the pecl_http fetch, also needs an equivilent post method in pecl_http

needs a completely new fullscrape implemetation, one that doesnt require the amount of ram it does now

completed method that allows you to make use of publicbts compressed scrape which is updated every 5 or so minutes, but works in the same manner as the fullscrape (see above)

include interface to opentracker, ie a method for users to upload new whitelisted torrents (since the list is in flatfile format; this interface would automatically be compatible with erdgeists opentracker software, for example)
