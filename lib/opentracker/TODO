perhaps a sync method using the new history table (could use the below implementation)

i have a compact scrape method in mind, it works just like a compact announce, but whether or not this would make any use by adding it in isnt for me to 
decide, thats for the people who write clients to decide if they want to support it or not. heres the idea that i've done a rough implenetation of:

	- as per some compliance with the original compact announce, which would pack the peer IP address (unsigned long, big endian), followed by the peer
	  port (unsigned short, big endian), the scrape method would pack the sha1 infohash (hex string, high nibble), followed by complete, incomplete, and
	  downloaded values (all unsigned short, big endian). so far this seems to cut the scrape size down to about 1/2 / 1/3 of what it is in bencoded
	  format.

	- unpacking is hardly any effort, a verbose way would look like this in PHP (be sure to make note of the 40, othwerise you'll only unpack 1 character)
	  $newoutput = unpack('H40infohash/ncomplete/nincomplete/ndownloaded',$output);
	
	- a fullscrape method would require you to the same as above, but you will need to break up each chunk which is seperated by "{|}" (no quotations).
	  the reasoning for the "{|}" is the compact method used can generate a lot of random characters that could possibly end up next to each other, so
	  we'll see how long it takes to break this format (naturally, of course)
	  $newoutput = unpack('H40infohash/ncomplete/nincomplete/ndownloaded',$output)
	  $array = explode('{|}',$newoutput);
	  foreach ($array as $infohash) { /* ... */ }

	- and to clarify, this would be requested in the exact same manner as a compact announce; just make sure the scrape url looks like this in the end:
	  1: /scrape?info_hash=___&info_hash=___&compact
	  2: /scrape?info_hash=___&compact
	  3: /scrape?compact
	  
	- i don't make any claims over this idea, i'm sure someone else has already came up with this by now, so do whatever with it
	  
ipv6 is implemented in such a way to implement what is documented on the below url, but it is commented out due to being unsupported by any clients
