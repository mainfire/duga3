Дуга-3 / Duga-3 / Arc-3 - a bittorrent crawler

Installing is simple, just fill out config.php. After that, make sure that the WEBROOT and LIBROOT directories are chmodded to 0777.
This is because of automation with creating folders, etc. DO NOT CHMOD ANY DUGA-3 FILES TO 0777!! Be sure to check out the below 
graph thing for a bit on how to set it up right.

|-- [ web root (acessible) ]
|-- index.php (an example file provided showing how to build a site around the database)
|-- admin/
|-- admin/index.php >--------->--------  (the "admin" interface, or crawler)
|-- [ lib root (inacessible) ]         |
|-- lib/                               v
|-- lib/crawler                        |
|-- lib/crawler/....                   |
|-- lib/crawler/....                   |
|-- lib/crawler/request.php <----<-----  (it needs to require_once "some/path/to_lib/crawler/request.php";)

From there, so long as your MySQL information is correct, just log into the admin interface and it will install itself.

As for usability, this has been tested and works on BSD, Linux, and Win32 PHP installations.

Extra thanks to avuc.nl for providing an account on a Debian box to do further testing on :)
