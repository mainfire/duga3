opentracker II - based on flippy's script

Installing is simple, just fill out config.php. After that, make sure you put announce.php, scrape.php, and lib/ where you want
them to be. The announce and scrape files that are NOT in lib/opentracker are the ones you have clients call. You should use a 
server level method to block users from requesting anything from the lib directory, as a precaution. As an example

|-- [ web root (acessible) ]
|-- scrape.php >----------->-----------
|-- announce.php >--------->---------  |
|-- [ lib root (inacessible) ]       | |
|-- lib/                             v v
|-- lib/opentracker                  | |
|-- lib/opentracker/announce.php <---  |
|-- lib/opentracker/config.php         |
|-- lib/opentracker/functions.php      |
|-- lib/opentracker/scrape.php <--<----

As you can see, make sure that where ever you do put the client announce.php and scrape.php, that they point toward the right
location and file (open the file and set the location yourself, its 1 line).

From there, all you need you to do is just create your torrent with your new announce url and run it; the tracker will install
itself from there. You can clean the tracker out by dropping the announce table from MySQL, and after that it will again 
reinstall itself the next time a client announces or scrapes.

If you decide to use either the blacklist or whitelist, the idea in using it is to specify the 40 byte SHA1 infohash of a torrent
in the array. In example:

$infohash_list = array
(
	'00F57EA41FA3504425F6E09EAE43F8325164A6B4',
	'FBDD02B6A9F266434B412D1EBEC3897F771E8B07',
);

Depending on what list type is set, the tracker will either track only the above hashes, or everything except the above hashes.
Any other value than "whitelist or "blacklist" will completely disable the list mechanism and the tracker will run 100% open.
