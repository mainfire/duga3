needs an example of how to upload a new torrent to the database, specifically one that can be handled with the current layout of the crawler (ie, not breaking it, etc).

needs a better way to catch the "inner exceptions" within the pecl_http fetch, also needs an equivilent post method in pecl_http

needs a completely new fullscrape implemetation, one that doesnt require the amount of ram it does now

completed method that allows you to make use of publicbts compressed scrape which is updated every 5 or so minutes, but works in the same manner as the fullscrape (see above)

since we have a nice bencode class in opentracker that works a lot like duga-3's bdeocde class (usage wise), a new function could be added that allows you to you recreate all torrents in the database

	- this would be ideal for people who want to brand torrents uploaded in the comments section, for example
	- this would be hugely helpful for removing the dead trackers from torrents crawled from (in example) the pirate bay, which would in turn give more reliable torrents for everyone

include interface to opentracker, ie a method for users to upload new whitelisted torrents (since the list is in flatfile format; this interface would automatically be compatible with erdgeists opentracker software, for example)
